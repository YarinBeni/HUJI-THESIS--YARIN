ABSTRACT
This work presents a corpus of transliterated cuneiform tablets from the Electronic
Babylonian Library (eBL) platform, including a public API endpoint to download the
latest version of the data, and a Python library to parse the transliterations in ATF
format. As of the time of writing, the constantly growing dataset contains around
25,000 tablets with over 350,000 lines of transliterated text. This dataset is a sizeable
addition to open-source cuneiform data and a major milestone for research within the
fields of cuneiform studies and NLP.

CONTEXT
Cuneiform writing was originally developed around 3,200 BCE in southern Mesopotamia
(modern-day Iraq) to write the Sumerian language, and was later adapted for languages like
Hittite, Hurrian, Luwian, Urartian, and most prominently Akkadian, one of the best attested
languages from antiquity. Cuneiform is formed by wedge-shaped imprints (Latin cuneus)
pressed into damp clay tablets (see Figure 1). The most recent known cuneiform tablet is dated
to 75 CE (Sachs, 1976). The tablets that have been excavated are today stored in different
museums worldwide (Streck, 2010), some of which have started digitizing their collections. A
major digitization effort, spearheaded by the CDLI (Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative, 2023),
has resulted in the digital capture of tens of thousands of tablets over the past 30 years.

The representation in Latin characters of signs of a tablet is called transliteration. A digital
transliteration system that includes markup for all phonetic and graphic features, the ASCIITransliteration-Format (ATF) (a name that is now anachronistic, since the format can use
Unicode) was created by the CDLI in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and later modified by
Tinney (2023) and named Oracc ATF.
CDLI, a database that contains records for more than 300,000 tablets, represents the largest
publicly available digital collection of photographs and transliterations of cuneiform tablets.
About 50 percent of the roughly half a million cuneiform tablets which have been excavated so
far have not yet been transliterated or published (Streck, 2010).
The dataset in this paper was collected as part of the Electronic Babylonian Literature (eBL)
project. The core of eBL is its online platform which provides easy access to an extensive
collection of transliterations of cuneiform tablets along with tools that allow users to search
the data and produce new transliterations of formerly unedited tablets. This way eBL seeks
to offer a solution to the challenges posed by the fragmentary nature of the Mesopotamian
written documentation. The eBL website and associated software projects are open-source
and the individual records can be freely accessed through the browser (cf. Figure 1). The public
API together with the Python code presented in this paper aims to make the entire dataset
easy to access and process using our ATF parser.
2 METHOD
SOURCES
The catalogue of the eBL platform currently contains 262,717 records of cuneiform tablets,
comprising the cuneiform collections of the British Museum, the Penn Museum, the Yale
Babylonian Collection, the Hilprecht Collection, and the Vorderasiatisches Museum, among
others. Of these, almost 25,000 are available in transliteration, and 52,105 in photographs;
eBL is authorized to utilize and showcase the images with consent of the specific museum
mentioned in each image. The initial list of museum numbers of the eBL platform was compiled
using the catalogues of the CDLI, The British Museum Digital Collections (2023), Yale Babylonian
Collection (2023) and other published and unpublished catalogues; the fields of the catalogue
have been populated by the eBL team, who has also produced the transliterations. New tablets
are constantly added and each document is subject to a careful revision process by the team
before being entered into the database.
STEPS
Around 20,000 photos have been produced by photographers working for the eBL project. They
cannot be reproduced without the explicit consent of the collections in which the objects are
kept. The transliterations in the dataset have been produced by Assyriologists working at the eBL
project, starting in 2018. In addition, transliterations have been entered by Assyriologists working
at the projects Edition of the Omen Series Šumma Alu (Mittermayer, 2017–2021) and Typology
and potential of the excerpt tablets of Šumma alu (Mittermayer, 2022–2023); Introducing Assyrian
Medicine: Healthcare Fit for a King (Taylor, 2020–2023) Reading the Library of Ashurbanipal: A
Multi-sectional Analysis of Assyriology’s Foundational Corpus (Taylor & Jiménez, 2020–2023), and
Cuneiform Artefacts of Iraq in Context (Jiménez, Sallaberger, & Radner, 2023–2046). Many of the
over 25,000 transliterations have been produced solely on the basis of the photographs and have
not been checked against the originals in museums. The transliterations are created using an
online ATF editor that is part of the eBL platform. Once saved, the transliterations are parsed to a
JSON tree using our ATF parser and saved in the database.
QUALITY CONTROL
A permission and revision system was implemented at the beginning of the project to maintain
high quality of the data. Each transliteration is reviewed by another expert and changes are
tracked, documenting the edit history of each document.

2.1 DATASET DESCRIPTION
2.2 DESCRIPTION
The dataset is a single JSON file which contains a list of objects (so-called “fragments”, since
most cuneiform tablets in the dataset are fragmentary). Each fragment contains an id (e.g.
ND.5513) which can be used to find the fragment in the browser (see Figure 1), a short description,
metadata such as the name of the collection, the museum and information on the publication
history. There is additional information on the editors and the edit history of the transliteration,
specified under “records”, the genre, script type, pointers to external collections containing the
item and many more properties. The transliteration of the fragment is saved as the “atf” property
(as plain text, i.e. a string) which can be parsed into a JSON tree, as explained in detail below.
3 DOWNLOADING AND PROCESSING THE DATA
The eBL fragments Python code (see 1) can be used to download and parse all openly available
transliterated documents using our public API. The eBL-ATF parser, which is an integral part of the
eBL-API, has been made accessible as a standalone Python package in the eBL fragments Python
code. Since eBL-ATF is a superset of standard ATF, the latter can be easily converted to eBL-ATF. For
details on the parser and compatibility with Oracc ATF, the reader is referred to our documentation.
The dataset at Zenodo contains all the fragments available on the 1st of September 2023. To get
an up-to-date version, the eBL fragments Python code provided should be used.

4 REUSE POTENTIAL
For traditional philology the dataset is of enormous value, since it allows access to tens of
thousands of cuneiform tablets previously unpublished. It has been estimated that all the
tablets preserved in the world’s museums as a whole contain about 10,000,000 words (Streck,
2010, 54–55): the dataset published here, compiled mostly from scratch, contains 350,000
lines that were previously inaccessible. This wealth of new data has already propelled the
process of piecing back fragments for reconstructing fragments that were in a fragmentary
state: alone in the compilation of the corpus 1,250 “joins” (i.e., fragments that belong together)
have been detected. The dataset has also been used for easy identification of the content of
fragments that would otherwise be difficult to identify.
NLP tasks for cuneiform scripts include, among others, generating automatic transliterations
from signs to readings (Gordin et al., 2020), restoring damaged signs (Fetaya, Lifshitz, Aaron,
& Gordin, 2020), matching fragments with their corresponding parts to reconstruct complete
fragments, and machine translation from Akkadian to English (Gutherz, Gordin, Sáenz, Levy, &
Berant, 2023). For an overview of different NLP tasks in Assyriology see Sahala (2021). The images
can be used for semi-supervised or unsupervised OCR methods (Rusakov, Somel, Fink, & Müller,
2020). For recent advances in visual methods for cuneiform script see Bogacz and Mara (2022).
